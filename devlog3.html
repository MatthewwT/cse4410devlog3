                        <p class="lead"><br>Leading up to creating the puzzle rooms we ran into a few difficulties, mainly those that 
                        were of time management and communication.  We had to ensure that everyone was on the same page working towards
                        the same goals; we also had to verify our Unity versions were the same and that we kept the main version of our game 
                        on github so everyone could access it.  Delays in some code held us back but we were able to overcome it and keep
                        working towards our progress.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><br>As the team had other priorities, the progress halted steeply on the video game design. 
                        We discussed many ideas and topics and also researched many tutorials on the side so we can implement it by ourselves
                        while waiting to combine them into one Unity folder. One of these tutorials (introduced by team member Peter) is 
                        located at this link here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPJCHvNZuCVTz6lvhR81nnaf1a-b67U">Build a 2D Platformer Game in Unity</a> </p>
                        
                            
                        <p class="lead"><br>While working on tutorials, we also discussed other items that were not
                        on our radar.  This included a menu when the player presses a button (for example the esc button), music design,
                        more art design for progressing levels, and more puzzle ideas that were not too difficult but at the same time
                        not too easy.  By the end of this course we might only have the bare bones video game as the sound design and 
                        most of the level designs might not be as flushed out as we would like.  </p>
